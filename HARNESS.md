# HARNESS.md — warehouse-harness-template v1

This file is the canonical description of every sensor and guide in this
template: what it does, what it costs, and when in the change lifecycle it
runs. Every instantiated repo should keep a copy of this file (or a link
to this one) so an agent working in that repo can answer "what harness do
I have, and why" without archaeology.

Reference: Birgitta Böckeler, "Harness engineering for coding agent users"
(martinfowler.com, 02 Apr 2026). Model: **guides** (feedforward) + **sensors**
(feedback), each either **computational** or **inferential**, spread across
three regulation categories: **maintainability**, **architecture fitness**,
**behaviour**.

---

## Guides (feedforward)

| File | Category | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` | computational | Entry point every agent session reads first: repo shape, commands, conventions. |
| `.claude/rules/domain-model.md` | computational | Ubiquitous language, aggregates, domain events — keeps an agent's vocabulary aligned with the real domain. |
| `.claude/rules/rest-api.md` | computational | Route → use case mapping, error/auth conventions. |
| `.claude/rules/integration-events.md` | computational | Kafka publish/consume contract, consumer-group rules. |
| `.claude/skills/how-to-*.md` | inferential | Reusable how-tos for recurring task shapes (add an endpoint, add an integration event, add a frontend remote, write an ADR, test). |
| ADRs (`adr/` or `docs/adr/`) | computational | Point-in-time architecture decisions with rationale — the fleet's real source of truth for "why," not just "what." |

## Sensors (feedback) — lifecycle position

| Sensor | Category | Type | Lifecycle | Blocking? | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `make fmt-check` / `lefthook pre-commit` | maintainability | computational | pre-commit | yes (local) | seconds |
| `lint` (golangci-lint) | maintainability | computational | pre-commit, PR | yes | seconds |
| `test` (`go test -race`) | maintainability | computational | pre-commit (fast subset), PR | yes | seconds–minutes |
| `coverage` (90% gate) | maintainability | computational | pre-push, PR | yes | minutes |
| `bdd` (godog/Gherkin) | behaviour | computational | pre-push, PR | yes | seconds |
| `arch-test` (arch-go fitness) | architecture fitness | computational | pre-push, PR | yes | seconds |
| `integration` (testcontainers) | behaviour | computational | PR | yes | minutes |
| `mutation-fast` (gremlins, one aggregate) | maintainability | computational | PR | yes | ~1 min |
| `mutation` (gremlins, full domain) | maintainability | computational | weekly schedule | no (advisory report) | tens of minutes |
| `vuln` (govulncheck) | maintainability | computational | PR | yes | seconds |
| `api-lint` (Spectral) | maintainability | computational | PR | yes | seconds |
| `docs-api-drift` | maintainability | computational | PR | yes | seconds |
| `web` (vitest/tsc/eslint) | maintainability | computational | PR | yes | minutes |
| `helm-lint` | maintainability | computational | PR (targeting main) | yes | seconds |
| `trivy-scan` | maintainability | computational | PR (targeting main) | yes (CRITICAL/HIGH w/ fix) | minutes |
| `CodeQL` | maintainability | computational | PR, schedule | yes (conversation-resolution) | minutes |
| `Scorecard` | maintainability | computational | schedule | no | minutes |
| `drift` (deadcode, `go mod tidy -diff`, knip, coverage-quality) | maintainability | computational | weekly schedule | **no — advisory** | minutes |
| `/code-review`, `/architecture-review`, `/domain-review` | architecture fitness / behaviour | **inferential** | invoked by hand (local-only, per user decision 2026-09-13) | no | LLM cost per invocation |

**New sensors default to advisory for ~2 weeks, then auto-promote to
blocking** (user decision, Phase 5 of the harness-coverage-expansion plan)
unless the sensor is inherently non-deterministic (inferential/LLM-based),
in which case it stays advisory until its precision is proven — see the
plan's Phase 4 risk notes.

## Fitness functions and the incidents that motivated them

Every rule in `internal/architecture/fitness_test.go` corresponds to a real,
already-lived incident, not a hypothetical:

- **TestHexagonalArchitecture** (6 rules) — the base ports-and-adapters
  dependency direction. Uncontroversial, but never assume it holds without
  running it: `order-management` shipped this same file for a period
  without ever wiring it into CI, and no one noticed.
- **TestMCPAdapterDependencyRule** (conditional, only if `cmd/mcp` exists)
  — ADR-0008: MCP servers are additive inbound adapters. Nothing may
  depend on the MCP package; it may depend only on application+domain.
- **TestNoAuthMiddlewareReintroduced** — encodes the fleet-wide
  2026-09-11 static-bearer-auth revert. An agent "helpfully" re-adding
  auth middleware fails CI instead of shipping unreviewed.
- **TestKafkaConsumerGroupNeverHardcodedInline** — wes-work-planning's
  hardcoded consumer group id let a locally-run e2e-tests process silently
  join the SAME consumer group as the live in-cluster Deployment on the
  shared platform Kafka broker, starving one of the two processes via
  Kafka's rebalance protocol. Fixed in wes-work-planning#67; this test
  keeps it fixed.
- **TestKafkaIntegrationTestsUseTestcontainers** — this fleet's CI
  `integration` job provisions Postgres only. A Kafka-touching
  `-tags=integration` test that gates on `os.Getenv("KAFKA_BROKERS")` +
  `t.Skip`, or hardcodes `localhost:9092`, silently skips or fails on
  every CI runner and proves nothing. testcontainers is the only variant
  that actually exercises the assertions.

## Mutation testing: what it catches that coverage doesn't

`go test -cover` measures whether a line EXECUTED during a test run.
gremlins measures whether a test would actually FAIL if that line's logic
were subtly wrong (each mutant is one such subtle change: `>=` to `>`, a
negated boolean, a swapped operand). 100% line coverage with a surviving
mutant means a test exercises the code path but asserts nothing about its
actual behaviour on that path — the "green tests that assert nothing"
failure mode the `drift` job's coverage-quality check is built to catch.

**gremlins fails when the measured value is `<=` the configured threshold**
(not `<`) — see `.gremlins.yaml`'s own comment. Always measure first
(`make mutation-full`), then set the threshold strictly below what you
measured; never copy a sibling repo's numbers.

**Pitfall: a tagless `switch { case ...: ... }` can under-report mutator
coverage versus the equivalent `if / if / return` chain**, even with
identical test coverage. Confirmed concretely on warehouse-ops-agent PR #58:
a pure threshold-classifier's mutator coverage measured 89.91% (below a
96% gate) as a switch, then 97.17–97.25% after rewriting as an if-chain,
with zero test changes. If a pure classification function's mutator
coverage comes in surprisingly low despite full branch coverage in
`go test -cover`, try the if-chain rewrite before assuming tests are
missing a case.

## Credential handling in this harness

Never embed a real password in a `scheme://user:PASSWORD@host` URL
anywhere in committed files, including local-dev-only test fixtures.
Some agent tooling treats that literal shape as a credential leak and
will silently strip/redact it on write AND read-back — a write that
"succeeds" but reads back unchanged is that guard firing, not a bug to
retry around. Use a password-less URL plus a separate `PGPASSWORD` env
var (shell-launched processes), or your driver's own password-injection
API (`pgx.ParseConfig` + setting `.Password` explicitly, for a single Go
process that needs several different DB passwords at once — see
e2e-tests' `dbOpen` helper for the concrete pattern).

## Instantiating this template

Run `scripts/new-service.sh <service-name> <richest-aggregate-pkg>` from a
fresh repo checkout. It substitutes every `{{SERVICE}}` / `{{SERVICE_REPO}}`
/ `{{RICHEST_AGGREGATE}}` placeholder and tells you which files still need
manual content (the `.claude/rules/*.md` skeletons, `.gremlins.yaml`'s
measured thresholds). See `scripts/new-service.sh`'s own header comment for
the full instantiation checklist.

## Versioning

This is `harness-template: v1`. Record that string in each instantiated
repo's `AGENTS.md` so a fleet-wide audit (see the `harness-audit` tool in
the companion `warehouse-systems-fleet-ops` skill) can tell which repos are
behind the template and by how much.
